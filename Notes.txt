# Recommendation System Working Logic

## Overview
The recommendation system is a **User-Based Collaborative Filtering (UBCF)** algorithm. It generates personalized recipe recommendations for a user by analyzing the preferences of other users with similar tastes. The system uses the following parameters to customize the recommendations:

1. **userId**: The ID of the user for whom the recommendations are being generated.
2. **topN**: The number of top recommendations to return (default is 5).
3. **minSimilarity**: The minimum similarity threshold for considering other users in the recommendation process (default is 0.1).

## How the Results are Generated

### 1. **Input Data**
The system uses two main datasets:
- **Users**: Contains information about users, including their favorited recipes.
- **Recipes**: Contains details about recipes, such as their names, dietary restrictions, and flavor tags.

### 2. **Steps in the Algorithm**

#### a. **User-Item Matrix Construction**
A binary matrix is created where:
- Rows represent users.
- Columns represent recipes.
- A value of `1` indicates that a user has favorited a recipe, while `0` indicates otherwise.

#### b. **Similarity Calculation**
The similarity between the target user (specified by `userId`) and other users is calculated using **Cosine Similarity**. This measures how similar the target user's preferences are to those of other users.

#### c. **Filtering by Similarity**
Only users with a similarity score greater than or equal to `minSimilarity` are considered for generating recommendations. This ensures that only users with sufficiently similar tastes influence the recommendations.

#### d. **Recommendation Scoring**
For each recipe not favorited by the target user, a score is calculated based on the weighted sum of similarities with other users who have favorited the recipe. The formula is:
\[
\text{Score} = \frac{\sum (\text{Similarity} \times \text{User's Interaction with Recipe})}{\sum \text{Similarity}}
\]

#### e. **Filtering by Preferences**
The recommendations are filtered to exclude recipes that:
- Violate the user's dietary restrictions.
- Contain allergens specified by the user.
- Do not match the user's flavor preferences (if specified).

#### f. **Sorting and Selection**
The filtered recommendations are sorted by their scores in descending order. The top `N` recipes (as specified by `topN`) are selected and returned.

### 3. **Example Request and Response**

#### Request:
```
GET http://localhost:3000/api/recommendation/recommendations?userId=67f8f85868cfdd633372367f&topN=5&minSimilarity=0.1
```

#### Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "id": "67eeb9c9dfcdada08d78fc4f",
      "name": "Chicken Fricassée"
    },
    {
      "id": "67eec0fcdfcdada08d7900b8",
      "name": "Pakora - Vegetable Fritters"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of the Response
1. **userId**: The recommendations are generated for the user with ID `67f8f85868cfdd633372367f`.
2. **topN**: The system returns the top 2 recommendations (as specified in the request).
3. **minSimilarity**: Only users with a similarity score of 0.1 or higher are considered.

#### How the Results Were Chosen:
- **"Chicken Fricassée"** and **"Pakora - Vegetable Fritters"** were favorited by users with high similarity to the target user.
- These recipes do not violate the target user's dietary restrictions or allergies.
- They match the target user's flavor preferences (if specified).

## Summary
The recommendation system uses collaborative filtering to analyze user preferences and generate personalized recipe suggestions. By adjusting parameters like `topN` and `minSimilarity`, the system can provide more tailored recommendations. The results are filtered and ranked to ensure they align with the user's dietary needs and preferences.
